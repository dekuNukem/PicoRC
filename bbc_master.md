## Kit Assembly

### Parts

Observe the parts:

### Soldering Notes

Nothing too tricky in this kit, all basic through-hole stuff.

If this is your first time, a few tips:

* Make sure your soldering iron has **proper temperature control**. Try your local makerspace or university lab.

* Use **leaded solder** and plenty of flux, temperature around 320C / 600F.

* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqvHogekDI4) covers the basics pretty well.

### Assembly

Insert the terminal blades and soldering them in place.

Make sure they are straight!

Push the power switch into the blanking plate as shown.

Offer up the switch assembly.

Make sure the switch sits flat. Adjust the two PCB so they are at **right angle**.

Once happy, solder the switch in place.

That's pretty much it!

### Cleaning

This is optional, but I like to clean off the flux with 90%+ isopropyl alcohol.

Submerge and scrub with a toothbrush.

Make sure it is **completely dry** before proceeding.

### Inspection

* Compare with the reference photos below.

* Solder joints should be **shiny and smooth**. If you see spikes, put on more flux and melt it again.

* There must be **no solder bridges**. If any, put on flux and melt it to remove.

## Pre-flight Checks

Use a multimeter to **check for dead shorts** between each rail and GND.

If all good, plug in a USB cable, turn on, and check the voltages.

## Installation

Push the cables into the terminal blades.

* Red is 5V

* Black is GND

* Blue is -5V

* Remove the top cover.

* Unplug 7 blade connectors on the motherboard

	* Grab the neck of the connector, wiggle straight up.

	* DO NOT pull on the cable itself!

* Undo 2 screws shown

* Lift and slide PSU **to the left** to remove

Insert the screw from the bottom as shown.

Then the washers, and the standoff. Tighten with a 5mm socket.

Connect the other end to the motherboard as shown.

VCC is red, 0V is black, -5V is blue.

Feel free to turn on and try it out!

* The charger / power bank should provide at least 3A current.

* Make sure the USB-C cable is high quality.

* Otherwise instabilities might occur.

If it works, tuck the wires neatly and reassemble. Enjoy!
